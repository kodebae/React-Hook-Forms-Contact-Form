# React-Hook-Forms-Contact-Form

## Installation
To get started run the following terminal command

`npm i`

This will allow us to create a React app. Next install React by typing the following command into your terminal

`npm create-react-app contact-form`

This creates all the necessary packages and dependencies that we need for our application. Now cd into the project folder and type the following into the terminal. 

`npm start`

Once the React app installs remove any files that are not needed. I deleted everything but the index.js file.
